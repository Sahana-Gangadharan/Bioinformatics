# Bioinformatics
Basic codes in Bioinformatics. 

These were written as a part of the course BT3040 - Bioinformatics, offered in Spring semester by Prof Michael Gromiha.

The course assignments and my solutions can be found here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGE-CGren9jbFDYPeSZDvHvid9gF2RpH?usp=sharing

The following codes are present in the jupyter notebook -

1. Compliment of DNA
2. Translation of mRNA
3. Positional occurance of a string in DNA
4. Average base stacking energy
5. Dot plot of two DNA strands
6. Penta match in two DNA strands
7. BLAST of two DNA strands
8. BLAST properties - Sequence identity, similarity, query coverage and gap percentage
9. Construction of BLOSUM62 matrix
10. Conservation properties - Entropy, Variance and Sum of all pairs for each position in Multiple sequence alignment of a given strand
11. Comparing MSA to find similar and dissimilar alignments
12. Composition of a protein sequence
